I cried when you went away from me
And I saw my tears run dry
I cried until my eyes were grey
And I could not see the sun

I cried when I saw my face go still
White without a rose or tear
I cried until a voice came near
And hung magic on the air

I cried (I, oh I cried) when you went away (when you went away) from me (from me oh oh oh ohoh)
And I saw (and I saw) my tears run dry (my tears run dry, yes I did) 
I cried until (I cried, I cried out tears) my eyes (oh my eyes were so grey) were grey
And I (and I, oh I) could not see the sun (could not see the sun yeah)

Crystals (crystal, crystal) of home were high
Gold and silver days flew and I breathed
Oh and joy (joy, joy) drew close and close
Looked into my eyes and it was me
Oh, and then crystals (crystal, crystal) of home were high
Gold and silver days flew and I breathed

Oh and joy (joy) joy, joy joy joy drew close and close
And looked into my eyes and it was me
Oh, and looked into my eyes and it was me
I cried I cried I cried I cried yes I did
Oh I cried I cried I cried, I
I cried (I cried)
